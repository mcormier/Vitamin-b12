A simple clone of [Vitamin-R](http://www.publicspace.net/Vitamin-R/)

* * *

*Vitamin-R* is a $20 OS X app. It's not worth $20.  The core functionality
of the application is a timer that makes noise. Every other feature in
the application is fluff. 

If you want to experiment with the [Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) 
then this app should get you by for free.  It's not polished yet but it gets the job
done with out all the whiz bang features that 
[productivity porn](http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Productivity_pr0n) addicts drool
over.
