**Vitamin-B12** is a simple clone of [Vitamin-R](http://www.publicspace.net/Vitamin-R/)

**Vitamin-R** is a $20 OS X app. It's not worth $20.  The core functionality
of the application is a timer that makes noise. Every other feature in
Vitamin-R is fluff. Vitamin-B12 masquerades as a OS X application but is 
implemented using a shell script. 

If you want to experiment with the [Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) 
then this app should get you by for free.  It's not polished yet but it gets the job
done with out all the whiz bang features that 
[productivity porn](http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Productivity_pr0n) addicts drool
over.

**Usage**

You can either run **Vitamin-B12** as an app or from the command line. To run it from
the command line simply execute run.sh that is embedded in the app directly.

You can optionally specify the length of time to run in minutes from the command line.
The default length is 25 minutes.
